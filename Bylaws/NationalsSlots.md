# Austin Practical Shooting Club (APSC) Bylaws for USPSA Nationals Slot Allocation

## Introduction
As an independent club not governed by a section, the Austin Practical Shooting Club (APSC) in Austin, TX, establishes these bylaws to outline a clear, fair, and transparent process for assigning slot codes for various USPSA nationals matches as received from headquarters.

## Slot Request Process
1. **Notification of Availability**: The club president will notify members via email about available slot codes.
2. **Expression of Interest**: Members interested in a slot must reply to the email with a "YES" within five (5) days of the notification email's date.

## Eligibility Criteria
Members must meet all the following criteria to be eligible for a slot code:

1. **Membership Duration**: Must have been a member of APSC for at least six (6) months of the qualifying year.
2. **Participation Requirement**: Must have participated in at least three (3) matches at APSC during the qualifying year.
3. **USPSA Membership**: Must be an active member of USPSA for the year in which the nationals will be held.

## Slot Assignment
- **Based on Performance**: Slot codes will be assigned to eligible respondents based on their ELO rank. The ELO ranking will consider all matches shot at APSC during the qualifying year.
    - **Accuracy of Match Registration**: It is crucial for members to accurately register for matches using their correct shooter number and consistent naming. Data inconsistencies, such as incorrect shooter numbers or modified names, may prevent the accurate calculation of an ELO ranking. APSC is not responsible for any ranking issues that arise from errors in match registration on PractiScore.

## Slot Code Reassignment
- **Unable to Use Slot**: If a slot recipient cannot use their slot code, they must make a best faith effort to notify the APSC president as soon as possible so that the slot can be reassigned to the next eligible member.

## Financial Responsibility
- **Costs Incurred**: Slot recipients acknowledge that they are personally responsible for all expenses related to match entry, travel, and any other related costs.

By adhering to these bylaws, APSC ensures a fair and transparent process for all members interested in participating in USPSA nationals matches. These rules are designed to reflect the club's commitment to competitive integrity and member participation.
