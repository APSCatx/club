# Closest-To-Time Challenge Rules

## Overview
The Closest-To-Time Challenge is a precision timing stage where competitors must knock down five steel poppers with their final hit as close as possible to a predetermined time. The stage emphasizes a shooter's internal timing abilities rather than pure speed.

## Stage Setup
* 5 steel poppers
* Shooting position clearly marked
* Reset required between each competitor

## Time Setting
1. The official stage time will be set the morning of the match by match officials
    * Time will be between 4.0 and 10.0 seconds
    * Time will be measured to the tenth of a second (e.g., 6.2 seconds)
    * The set time will remain secret until the morning of the match

## Scoring
1. The winner will be determined by:
    * Measuring the time of the last steel popper hit
    * Calculating which shooter's final hit time was closest to the preset time
    * Example: If the set time is 6.2 seconds:
        * Shooter A final hit: 6.0 seconds (0.2 off)
        * Shooter B final hit: 6.3 seconds (0.1 off)
        * Shooter C final hit: 5.9 seconds (0.3 off)
        * Shooter B would win

2. Ties will be resolved by:
    * All tied shooters will reshoot the stage
    * Closest to the original set time in the reshoot wins
    * This process will repeat until a winner is determined

## Stage Procedure
1. Competitor will start from designated position
2. At the start signal, engage all 5 steel poppers
