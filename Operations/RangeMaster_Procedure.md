# Austin Practical Shooting Club (APSC) Range Master Procedure

## Introduction

This document outlines the responsibilities and procedures for Range Masters (RMs) at Austin Practical Shooting Club events held at the Austin Rifle Club (ARC) facility. The primary duty of the Range Master is to ensure range safety by verifying that all stages are set up to prevent:

1. Rounds from exiting the range
2. Injuries to participants and spectators
3. Damage to ARC property

These safety concerns are paramount, as violations could result in matches being banned from ARC.

This procedure works in conjunction with the Match Director Procedure document located at [Match Director Procedure](Operations/MatchDirector_Procedure.md).

## Role and Responsibility

The Range Master may be the Match Director (MD) or a designated individual appointed by the MD. Regardless of who fills this role, completing the safety verification process outlined in this document is **mandatory** before every match.

If issues are identified, the Range Master has the authority to require modifications to stage setups, even if this conflicts with the original stage design. **Range safety supersedes all other considerations**, including classifier measurements or stage designer preferences.

For a complete overview of Match Director responsibilities, refer to the Match Director Procedure document at [Match Director Procedure](Operations/MatchDirector_Procedure.md).

## Pre-Match Stage Verification

### Primary Safety Concerns

The two most critical safety issues to prevent are:

1. **Shots over the berm**: Most likely to occur with close targets set high, especially on range H (left side)
2. **Shots skipping off the ground**: Most common with targets not positioned at the sides of the range and with distance behind them

### Thorough Stage Inspection Process

For each stage:

1. **Walk through the entire shooting area** from multiple positions
2. **Check each target** from various angles and heights:
   - Move throughout the entire shooting area, not just the most obvious shooting positions
   - Adjust your eye level up and down to account for shorter and taller shooters
   - Consider all possible angles from which a competitor might engage a target
3. **Have a second person verify** questionable setups if there's any doubt

### Target Positioning Guidelines

#### Paper Targets

- **Target Placement**: Ensure all targets direct rounds safely into berms
- **Height Considerations**: 
  - Targets set too high risk shots over the berm
  - Targets set too low risk ground skips
- **Line of Fire**: Check what's behind and around each target
- **Shoot-Through Prevention**: Verify that the setup doesn't create potential shoot-through situations
- **Hard Objects**: Check for shots through targets potentially hitting hard objects like barrels or walls that could cause ricochets

#### Steel Targets

- **Positioning**: Steel must not be placed in the middle of the bay where misses are likely to skip
  - Move steel to the edges of the bay where possible
  - Ensure steel is positioned close to a berm
- **Minimum Distance**: Maintain minimum safe distances to steel
  - 7 yards with a physical barrier 
  - 8 yards without a barrier (USPSA rules)
- **Angle**: Set steel within approximately 10 degrees of square to the shooter
  - Ensure splatter zones do not extend toward the firing line or spectator areas
- **Stacked Steel**: Must be forward-falling to prevent "hammering down" and skipping rounds from already-falling steel

### Range-Specific Considerations

- **Range G Concerns**: 
  - Problematic with walls and target rail
  - Avoid shots that will impact side walls
  - Avoid shots into the target rail at the back
- **Range H Concerns**:
  - Left side is particularly prone to shots over the berm
- **Red Posts**: 
  - Avoid setting targets that may result in shots hitting red posts
  - These can be temporarily removed if necessary, but must be replaced after the match

### Common Problems and Solutions

#### For Paper Targets:

1. **Target too exposed at bottom** (risk of ground skip):
   - Add hard cover to block lower portion
   - Add a no-shoot to cover lower part
   - Move target further back or up (if berm height allows)

2. **Target positioned where shots could hit range equipment**:
   - Add protective no-shoots ("wall guards")
   - Reposition the target
   - Add appropriate hard cover

#### For Steel Targets:

1. **Steel too far forward in bay**:
   - Move closer to the berm
   - Reposition to ensure misses impact the berm
   - Consider replacing with paper targets if proper positioning isn't possible

2. **Steel angled improperly**:
   - Adjust to ensure splatter zone is safe
   - Move if proper angle can't be achieved in current position

## Pre-Match Verification Checklist

### Safety Verification Checklist

ðŸ”² **Paper Target Verification**:
   - ðŸ”² From every shooting position, check each target for safe bullet impact
   - ðŸ”² Verify no targets set up for potential shots over the berm
   - ðŸ”² Confirm no targets positioned to direct shots into flat ground
   - ðŸ”² Check that targets won't direct shots into hard objects (steel, walls, barrels)

ðŸ”² **Steel Target Verification**:
   - ðŸ”² Confirm all steel targets are close enough to backstop
   - ðŸ”² Verify steel targets are angled correctly (about 10Â° square to shooter)
   - ðŸ”² Ensure stacked steel is forward-falling
   - ðŸ”² Confirm minimum 7+ yards to steel from closest shooting position

ðŸ”² **Range Equipment Protection**:
   - ðŸ”² Check that shots won't impact range posts, rails, or other infrastructure
   - ðŸ”² Verify any temporarily removed range equipment is noted for replacement

ðŸ”² **Stage Equipment Verification**:
   - ðŸ”² Confirm correct number of targets per stage design
   - ðŸ”² Verify all steel targets are freshly painted
   - ðŸ”² Ensure activators are calibrated and properly staked in
   - ðŸ”² Check that all supporting equipment is fully secured

### Additional Match Operation Checks

ðŸ”² **Start positions** clearly defined and fair
ðŸ”² **180-degree rule** - check for potential traps
ðŸ”² **RO positions** - verify safe positions for Range Officers
ðŸ”² **Shoot-throughs** - check for unintended target engagement possibilities

## Implementing Safety Solutions

When potential safety issues are identified:

1. **Document the issue** (photos are helpful)
2. **Discuss with Stage Director & Match Director** if possible before making changes
3. **Implement appropriate fixes** such as:
   - Repositioning targets
   - Adding hard cover or no-shoots
   - Adjusting target angles
   - Removing problematic targets or props
4. **Re-verify after modifications**

Remember: **Range safety supersedes MD & SD desire for specific target placements.**

## Conclusion

The Range Master's thorough verification of all stages is essential to maintaining safety at APSC matches held at ARC. By diligently following this procedure, you help ensure the continued ability of the club to use these facilities while providing a safe environment for all participants.

The Range Master should coordinate with the Match Director to ensure that both this procedure and the Match Director Procedure at [Match Director Procedure](Operations/MatchDirector_Procedure.md) are followed for a successful and safe match.
