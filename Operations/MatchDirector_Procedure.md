# Austin Practical Shooting Club (APSC) Match Directors SOP

## Introduction
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is designed to guide Match Directors (MDs) of the Austin Practical Shooting Club in executing their duties before, during, and after each match at the Austin Rifle Club (ARC) range. Adhering to these steps will ensure consistency across events and compliance with ARC rules.

### Arriving to the Range
Upon arrival, MDs must ensure the range is accessible and prepared for the day's event while preventing damage to the facility.

- **Lock the Gate Open**: Secure the main gate in an open position to allow participants easy access.
- **Ed Building Gate for Muddy Conditions**: If conditions are muddy, prevent erosion by unlocking and opening the Ed Building gate. This allows trailers to be pulled via the road, avoiding damage to the hill.

### Stage Verification
Proper stage setup is crucial for safety and fair competition.

- **Target Placement for Safety**: Confirm that all targets are positioned so that rounds impact the berms safely. Consider the perspective of shooters of various heights to ensure visibility and safety.
- **Shoot Through Prevention**: Check each stage to ensure that the setup does not create potential shoot-through situations, which could endanger participants or bystanders.
- **Stage Directors Checklist**:
  - Verify the presence of the correct number of targets per stage.
  - Ensure that all steel targets are freshly painted for visibility and scoring accuracy.

### New Shooter Briefing
First-time participants require orientation to understand club rules and safety procedures.

- **Delegate Briefing Responsibilities**: Assign a knowledgeable individual to conduct the new shooter briefing using the APSC outline sheet. This ensures consistency in the information provided.

### Shooter Briefing
Communicate essential information to all participants before the start of the match.

- **ARC Membership Reminder**: Inform non-ARC members to keep their blue bands visible at all times.
- **Equipment Handling**:
  - Remind participants to return activators and cables to the supply trailer after use.
  - Instruct that poppers and their bases should remain with the stage trailers, not returned to the supply trailer.
- **Early Departure Protocol**: Advise participants needing to leave early to obtain a one-time code from the MD.
- **Equipment Pickup**:
  - Request one member from each squad to pick up a bucket for their group.
  - Note that timers and tablets stay on the bay and should not be moved.
- **Barrel and Firearm Handling**:
  - If barrels do not fit on the stage trailer, they should be returned to the barrel trailer.
  - Emphasize that the range is a cold range. Firearms should only be handled at the safe table or under the direct supervision of a Range Officer (RO). Firearms must not be unbagged at vehicles.

### Leaving the Range
Ensuring the range is left in a clean, secure state is essential for maintaining good relations with ARC and for the safety and security of the facility.

- **Bay Inspection**: Check each bay for items that have not been put away or that may have been left behind by participants.
  - Any found items should be placed in the supply trailer for lost and found purposes.
- **Main Gate**: Unlock the main gate to return it to its normal operating state.
- **Ed Building Gate Security**: Ensure the Ed Building swing gate is closed and locked, securing the area.

## Conclusion
Following this SOP will help maintain the high standards of safety, fairness, and enjoyment for which the Austin Practical Shooting Club is known. Match Directors play a critical role in achieving these standards and are appreciated for their dedication and adherence to these procedures.
