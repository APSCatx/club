# Austin Practical Shooting Club (APSC) Match Directors SOP

## Introduction
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is designed to guide Match Directors (MDs) of the Austin Practical Shooting Club in executing their duties before, during, and after each match at the Austin Rifle Club (ARC) range. Adhering to these steps will ensure consistency across events and compliance with ARC rules.

The Match Director may also serve as the Range Master (RM) or appoint a qualified person to fill this role. If a separate Range Master is appointed, the MD should coordinate closely with them to ensure all safety protocols are followed according to the Range Master Procedure document located at [Range Master Procedure](Operations/RangeMaster_Procedure.md).

### Arriving to the Range
Upon arrival, MDs must ensure the range is accessible and prepared for the day's event while preventing damage to the facility.

- **Lock the Gate Open**: Secure the main gate in an open position to allow participants easy access.
- **Ed Building Gate for Muddy Conditions**: If conditions are muddy, prevent erosion by unlocking and opening the Ed Building gate. This allows trailers to be pulled via the road, avoiding damage to the hill.

### Stage Verification
The Match Director must ensure proper stage setup for safety and fair competition. While detailed safety protocols are outlined in the Range Master Procedure, the MD should:

- **Coordinate with Range Master**: If a separate RM is appointed, ensure they have completed the stage safety verification according to the RM Procedure document at [Range Master Procedure](Operations/RangeMaster_Procedure.md). If the MD is serving as RM, they must personally complete this verification.
- **Stage Safety Overview**: Verify that all stages have been checked to ensure:
  - All targets are positioned to direct rounds safely into berms
  - No potential shoot-through situations exist
  - Steel targets meet minimum distance requirements and are properly angled
  - Activators and supporting equipment are properly staked
  - All targets meet the count specified in the stage design
  
Refer to the Range Master Procedure for detailed safety verification steps and examples of proper/improper target placement.

### New Shooter Briefing
First-time participants require orientation to understand club rules and safety procedures.

- **Delegate Briefing Responsibilities**: Assign a knowledgeable individual to conduct the new shooter briefing using the APSC outline sheet. This ensures consistency in the information provided.

### Shooter Briefing
Communicate essential information to all participants before the start of the match.

- **Thank Volunteers**: Emphasize that the club does not function without volunteers and express appreciation for those who help make the match possible.
- **ARC Membership Reminder**: Inform non-ARC members to keep their blue bands visible at all times.
- **Teardown**: After each squad finishes their last stage, participants should assist with tear down and ensure all stage elements are returned to the stage trailers, except for activators as noted in the equipment handling section.
- **Equipment Handling**:
  - Remind participants to return activators and cables to the supply trailer after use.
  - Instruct that poppers and their bases should remain with the stage trailers, not returned to the supply trailer.
- **Stage Director Input**: Ask each stage director if they have anything specific to call out about their stage that participants should be aware of.
- **Early Departure Protocol**: Advise participants needing to leave early to obtain a code from the MD.
- **Equipment Pickup**:
  - Request one member from each squad to pick up a bucket for their group.
  - Note that timers and tablets stay on the bay and should not be moved.
- **Barrel and Firearm Handling**:
  - If barrels do not fit on the stage trailer, they should be returned to the barrel trailer.
  - Emphasize that the range is a cold range. Firearms should only be handled at the safe table or under the direct supervision of a Range Officer (RO). Firearms must not be unbagged at vehicles.

### Leaving the Range
Ensuring the range is left in a clean, secure state is essential for maintaining good relations with ARC and for the safety and security of the facility.

- **Last Man Out**: Do a sweep of the action bays to ensure that anyone wearing a blue band leaves before the match director.
- **Bay Inspection**: Check each bay for items that have not been put away or that may have been left behind by participants.
  - Any found items should be placed in the supply trailer for lost and found purposes.
- **Main Gate**: Unlock the main gate to return it to its normal operating state.
- **Ed Building Gate Security**: Ensure the Ed Building swing gate is closed and locked, securing the area.

## Conclusion
Following this SOP will help maintain the high standards of safety, fairness, and enjoyment for which the Austin Practical Shooting Club is known. Match Directors play a critical role in achieving these standards and are appreciated for their dedication and adherence to these procedures.

The Match Director should work in coordination with the Range Master (whether as separate individuals or a single person fulfilling both roles) to ensure all safety protocols in the Range Master Procedure document at [Range Master Procedure](Operations/RangeMaster_Procedure.md) are followed.
